##a swarm simulation program
simulates a multi-agent system with no top level of control.  All movements of swarm members are determined by that particular individual, with only local information.  The idea of this program is to study how individual behavior maps to collective behavior.

##how to run ..
1. import project into eclipse
2. replace the 3 jars in build path with the 3 jars in the '/jars' folder
3. run with 'simulation/common/startSimulation.java'  

##create your own behaviors and try some things out!
